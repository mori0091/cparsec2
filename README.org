* What is this?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-this
:END:

The *CPARSEC2* is a parser combinator library for C/C++ language.

- Supporting C/C++ standards ::
  - C11
  - C++17
  
- Supporting OS/Environments :: 
  - *Msys* (MSYS2 on 64bit Windows)
  - *Mingw* (MINGW64 on 64bit Windows)
  - *Ubuntu 18.04* (including WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux)
  - or else (probably works well but not tested)

* Why for C11?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: why-for-c11
:END:

1. It's my exercise :laughing:
2. Maybe useful to develop C compiler written in C
3. Maybe useful to develop a testing framework for C
4. To research more useful usecase of ~_Generic~ selector of C11
5. etc.

* How to build
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-to-build
:END:

To build anything all in the *CPARSEC2* project, it is convenient to use
~build.sh~ - a /batch-make/ shell script.

- Usage :: build.sh [options] [target] ...

~build.sh [options] [target] ...~ run ~make -C <dir> [options] [target] ...~ for
all directory ~<dir>~ in the project where a =GNUmakefile= or a =Makefile=
exists.

To build and test anything all in the project:
#+begin_src shell
# at the top of project directory
./build.sh all test
#+end_src shell

*See also [[file:docs/HOW_TO_BUILD.org][HOW TO BUILD]] to build/test each subproject individually.*
